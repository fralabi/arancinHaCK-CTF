Stegseek is a lightning fast steghide cracker that can be used to extract hidden data from files.<br>
- [CrackStation](https://crackstation.net/)<br>
CrackStation uses massive pre-computed lookup tables to crack password hashes.<br>
- [Cipher Identifier](https://www.boxentriq.com/code-breaking/cipher-identifier)<br>
Cipher Identifier uses AI/Machine Learning technology to recognize over 25 common cipher types and encodings
- [Caesar Cipher Cracker](https://www.nayuki.io/page/automatic-caesar-cipher-breaker-javascript)<br>
- [Vigenere Cracker](https://www.guballa.de/vigenere-solver)<br>
This online tool breaks Vigen√®re ciphers without knowing the key. Besides the classical variant Beaufort ciphers and Autokey ciphers are supported as well.<br>
- [Substitution Cipher Cracker](https://planetcalc.com/8047/#:~:text=In%20cryptography%2C%20a%20substitution%20cipher%20is%20a%20method,letters%2C%20mixtures%20of%20the%20above%2C%20and%20so%20forth.)<br>

- [XOR Cracker](https://wiremask.eu/tools/xor-cracker/)<br>
This XOR deciphering tool will analyse the data to find n-grams and will be able to guess the key length.
Then based on knowledge of most frequent char and using frequency analysis it will be able to guess the key used to encrypt the data. <br>
